# AI Powered Dashboard

Welcome to the **AI Powered Dashboard**! This application provides an intuitive, interactive, and fully integrated environment for working with data in various stages of the machine learning lifecycle. From data import to model evaluation, this dashboard covers every step you need to handle, visualize, and model your data with AI.

## Features

This application includes the following key features:

### 1. **Data Import**
   - Upload datasets with ease, whether they are in CSV, Excel, or other common formats.

### 2. **Dashboard**
   - Analyze your data with interactive and dynamic visualizations powered by **Power BI** or other tools.

### 3. **Data Preparation**
   - Clean, structure, and preprocess your data, preparing it for model training.

### 4. **AI Modeling**
   - Train and test AI models, using different algorithms for prediction and classification.

### 5. **Models Evaluation**
   - Assess the performance of your models using key metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and others.

### 6. **Guide**
   - Get step-by-step instructions and a user guide for navigating through the application and using its features.
